# CheeseCake - Henry Carver, Kevin Lin, Kevin Feng

We decided to use the body from Kevin Lin's and the main method from Henry's because each respective part was more robust and clearer. 
Kevin Lin's code threw exceptions to catch errors, and had a slight difference in a couple if statements for precision.

We decided to write our code with runtime that the API doesn't have. The API has constant time for the add method and linear time for the other methods. We have two linear methods, removeMin and add, while peekMin and isEmpty are constant.
